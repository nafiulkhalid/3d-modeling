# My 3D Modeling Collection
This repository contains a curated collection of open-source 3D models, each prepared for editing and 3D printing.  
> All designs are provided in standard formats for maximum compatibility with CAD software and 3D printers.

## File Types

- `.step` – Parametric 3D CAD model, editable in FreeCAD, Fusion 360, SolidWorks, etc.
- `.stl` – Mesh file for 3D printing, compatible with all slicers and printers.
- `.3mf` – Enhanced print-ready format (optional), supports metadata like colors and units.
